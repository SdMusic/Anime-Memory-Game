# UX

## 1.1 What is the Site About
'The Anime Memory Game' Is a interactive site allowing the user to play 3 different levels of anime related memory game.

## 1.2 What is the Purpose of the Site
The site has a practical and a theoretical purpose:

## Practical:
The practical purpose of this site is to showcase my abilities as a developer and to put into practice the knowledge I have acquired over the period of my course. This site concept of this practical application is to create a site that is interactive through JavaScript and using CSS and html styling, With a view to allow further development, for back end systems and updates to functionality. As such, the site is constructed with Bootstrap as a partial base with custom CSS overlaying and JavaScript functionality to show an understanding of these elements.

## Theoretical:
The goal is to create a page that allows the user access a anime related memory game, to help pass the time and have abit of fun. 

## 1.3 Who Built the Site and Why
This site was conceived, designed and built by Peter Freemantle for his second milestone project "Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project", as part of his Full-Stack Developer Diploma course from Code Institute, through Edinburgh Napier University. He has been a part of the hospitality industry and a chef from 2008-2020.

## 1.4 Concept
This will be a multiple page interactive website, allowing users to access 3 levels of a anime memory game. The home page will be a panel screen providing navigation to the users desired level choice, header with brand imaging and a footer with notable information. Each respective level page will have a navigation bar, matching banner text and footer and game elements across all pages. In desktop the links will keep across full screen, but move to a burger icon when in mobile, allowing for the content to be kept clear and visible. The new menu will have active screens set, allowing the user to know where they are on the site.

The site will be fully responsive and optimized to be viewed on different screen sizes and devices.

### WireFrames from concept

## 3 Technologies Used
### 3.1 HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language
Used to construct all the pages of this web site. For further info on this language; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

### 3.2 CSS or Cascading Style Sheets
Is used to style various elements on a web page via colouring, fonts, spacing, etc. For further info, see this link; https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html

### 3.3 Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.For ease of development, Bootstrap [v4.4.1] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) is employed in several areas of the site including:

### 3.4 Chrome DevTools
Web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. I used these tools at every step to test the functionality of my code. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools

### 3.5 Javascript
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions

### 3.6 Google Fonts
Fonts are provided by Google Fonts

### 3.7 Gitpod
An online IDE which streamlines developer workflows by providing prebuilt, collaborative development environments in your browser - powered by VS Code. It does not have to be installed on your PC. This website has been constructed using Gitpod IDE

### 3.8 GitHub Repository
This website is hosted on GitHub
GitHub Repository:https://github.com/SdMusic/Anime-Memory-Game
Deployed Link: https://sdmusic.github.io/Anime-Memory-Game/index.html

### 3.9 W3C Markup Validation Service
Used to run all html and CSS code through a validation to identify if the code meets current standards and whether or not it is showing errors. https://validator.w3.org/ https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

### 3.10 JShint service 
Used to run all Javascript through a validation to identify any code not confoming to current standards.
https://jshint.com/

### 4.0 Screenshot - Full Page Screen Capture
This is a chrome extension used to capture full screen images

## Deployment

The site is built on Gitpod, with all source code and assets hosted on GitHub. This is done through the following procedure

All files and code once saved is added to a temporary git directory using the [git add .] command.

"Added" files can then be committed to the git repository using the [git commit -m""] command. This requires commenting for each commit allowing you to see the changes that have been made and provide backup points.

The code is uploaded to the GitHub repository through the [git push] command.

Deployment to GitHub pages is done through the GitHub site; through settings, then GitHub pages and setting the live pages URL.

All versions are held on the master branch.

Prior to deployment, the site could be viewed in real time by adding the following command to the terminal window, and selecting "Open Browser" from the modal that displays: python3 -m http.server

To run localy:

Log in to GitHub and click on repository to download
select Code and click Download the ZIP file.
after download you can extract the file and use it in your local environment
Alternatively you can Clone or Fork this repository into your github account.

## Code Validation
At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code

- W3C CSS Validator to validate CSS
- Nu Html Checker to test HTML

Css and html is validated warnings remain on css due to webkits (these have been left to remain as they purely browser intigration)

## Testing

Testing has been carried out using the following devices/browsers:

Desktop
Chrome
Firefox
Chrome Responsive emulator
Huawei P30 Pro
Samsung Galaxy 7

### Page Layouts

I used http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ (source for top picture) to see how the site displays on ranging devices and their viewports, all pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices.


### Target audience Testing
Target audience testing was maintained through out the development of this project. It was used for design feedback wants 
of the audience and to uncover any bugs in the application. I had 3 children and 6 adults participate in this testing with the 
instructions of try to break this.

## Preformance Testing

I used Lighthouse (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), prefomance checker to assess the performance of my site.
screenshot below:

## Bugs & Fixes
- Timer starts when page loaded - added empty global var and assigned start function to fill
- Game able to be played before timer start - overlay added with pointer null to a start game fuction
- When clicked in quick succesion 3 card can remain displayed. Fixed with global var counting cards flipped and not allowing more than 2 
with var being reset when check match is called.
- Score displayed to decimal point, fixed by putting sum through new var and Math.round().
- Stop timer function not working - Scope changed to correct error.
