'The Anime Memory Game' Is a interactive site allowing the user to play 3 different levels of anime related memory game.

1.2 What is the Purpose of the Site
The site has a practical and a theoretical purpose:

Practical:
The practical purpose of this site is to showcase my abilities as a developer and to put into practice the knowledge I have acquired over the period of my course. This site concept of this practical application is to create a site that is interactive through JavaScript and using CSS and html styling, With a view to allow further development, for back end systems and updates to functionality. As such, the site is constructed with Bootstrap as a partial base with custom CSS overlaying and JavaScript functionality to show an understanding of these elements.

Theoretical:
The goal is to create a page that allows the user access a anime related memory game, to help pass the time and have abit of fun. 

1.3 Who Built the Site and Why
This site was conceived, designed and built by Peter Freemantle for his second milestone project "Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project", as part of his Full-Stack Developer Diploma course from Code Institute, through Edinburgh Napier University. He has been a part of the hospitality industry and a chef from 2008-2020.

1.4 Concept
This will be a multiple page interactive website, allowing users to access 3 levels of a anime memory game. The home page will be a panel screen providing navigation to the users desired level choice, header with brand imaging and a footer with notable information. Each respective level page will have a navigation bar, matching banner text and footer and game elements across all pages. In desktop the links will keep across full screen, but move to a burger icon when in mobile, allowing for the content to be kept clear and visible. The new menu will have active screens set, allowing the user to know where they are on the site.

The site will be fully responsive and optimized to be viewed on different screen sizes and devices.

 Deployment
The site is built on Gitpod, with all source code and assets hosted on GitHub. This is done through the following procedure

All files and code once saved is added to a temporary git directory using the [git add .] command.

"Added" files can then be committed to the git repository using the [git commit -m""] command. This requires commenting for each commit allowing you to see the changes that have been made and provide backup points.

The code is uploaded to the GitHub repository through the [git push] command.

Deployment to GitHub pages is done through the GitHub site; through settings, then GitHub pages and setting the live pages URL.

All versions are held on the master branch.

Prior to deployment, the site could be viewed in real time by adding the following command to the terminal window, and selecting "Open Browser" from the modal that displays: python3 -m http.server
